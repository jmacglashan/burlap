/**
 * This class is used for defining reward functions in grid worlds that are a function of cell of the world to which
 * the agent transitions. That is, a double matrix (called rewardMatrix) the size of the grid world is stored. In an agent transitions
 * to cell x,y, then they will receive the double value stored in rewardMatrix[x][y]. The rewards returned for transitioning to an agent position
 * may be set with the {@link #setReward(int, int, double)} method.
 * <p>
 * This reward function is useful for simple grid worlds without any location objects or worlds for which the rewards are independent
 * of location objects. An alternative to this class is to define worlds with location objects and use the atLocation propositional function
 * and location types to define rewards.

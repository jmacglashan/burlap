/**
 * Statically weighted A* [1] implementation. Epsilon is a parameter &gt; 1. The larger the value the more greedy the search. The returned solution
 * is guaranteed to be at most \epsilon times the optimal solution cost.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a terminal function is provided via the setter method defined for OO-MDPs, then the BestFirst search algorithm will not expand any nodes
 * that are terminal states, as if there were no actions that could be executed from that state. Note that terminal states
 * are not necessarily the same as goal states, since there could be a fail condition from which the agent cannot act, but
 * that is not explicitly represented in the transition dynamics.

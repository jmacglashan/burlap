 * A data structure for keeping track of elapsed and average time. Use {@link #start()} to start the timer

 * the current elapsed time since it was started. Use {@link #stop()} to stop the timer and
 * {@link #getTime()} to get the elapsed time between the last time the timer was started and stopped.
 * If you start and stop the timer multiple times, you can get the average time for all start-stops
 * using the {@link #getAvgTime()} method and the total time of all start-stops with {@link #getTotalTime()}.
 * If you want to check if the timer is running, use {@link #isRunning()}.

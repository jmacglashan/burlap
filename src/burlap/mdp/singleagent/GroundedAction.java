/**
 * A {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} is a high-level abstract class implementation of a {@link AbstractGroundedAction}
 * that is closely associated with single-agent {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} definitions. The role of
 * a {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} is to provide a reference to its corresponding {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action}
 * definition and also provide parameter assignments with which its {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} should be applied.
 * The set of possible {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} instances specifying the different possible parameter assignments
 * will be generated by the associated
 * {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action#getAllApplicableGroundedActions(State)} method. See
 * the {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} class documentation for more information on implementing parameterized
 * {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} definitions.
 * <p>
 * Implementing this class requires implementing three methods from {@link AbstractGroundedAction}
 * that are not implemented by {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction}:<p>
 * {@link #copy()}<p>
 * {@link #initParamsWithStringRep(String[])} and<p>
 * {@link #getParametersAsString()}.<p>
 * If the {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} with which the {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} is associated
 * is not parameterized, then you can return the concrete class {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.common.SimpleGroundedAction}.
 * Otherwise, you will need to make your own subclass of {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} and implement those methods.
 * Note that you can have your implementation store the parameter information anyway you like as long the {@link #copy()} method
 * creates a version instance of your {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction} implementation that copies over
 * the parameter information. Additionally, for full support with all BURLAP tools, it should be possible to initialize
 * the parameters with a String array using the {@link #initParamsWithStringRep(String[])} and get a String array representation
 * of them with the {@link #getParametersAsString()}.
 * <p>
 * In addition to specifying parameter assignment information for a {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} definition,
 * this class also provides a number of useful shortcut methods for evaluating the {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.GroundedAction}.
 * Specifically, see the<p>
 * {@link #executeIn(State)}<p>
 * {@link #executeIn(burlap.mdp.singleagent.environment.Environment)}<p>
 * {@link #getTransitions(State)} and<p>
 * {@link #applicableInState(State)} <p>
 * methods, which call the associated {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} methods providing this instance
 * as the set of parameters to use. Note that the {@link #getTransitions(State)} method
 * will throw a runtime exception if the associated {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} definition does
 * not implement the {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.FullActionModel} interface.
